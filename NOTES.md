## Notes

I'm following the django girls [tutorial](https://www.gitbook.com/book/djangogirls/djangogirls-tutorial/details),
and working in this directory: `~/djangogirls/`

They recommend using a virtual environment for every website project. I'll use 
conda environments instead; I created one called djangotutorial: 
`source activate djangotutorial`

Create the directories and files for a new django site:
`django-admin startproject mysite .`
